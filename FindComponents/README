Program Structure Notes

For PA4, I decided to implement the reccomended choice of having time be a local variable in DFS(), and dimply passing its address to visit() when called. I also implemented a field in my Graph known as components, which tracked whenever the transposed graph called visit() from DFS() and hence giving me the number of strong components there were in the graph. getComponents() simply returned this value.
